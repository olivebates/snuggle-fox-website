Project: SnuggleFox's Games portfolio (static HTML/CSS/JS) with Supabase-backed plays, ratings, total hours, and comments.

Purpose
- Showcase HTML game builds with click-to-play embeds.
- Track plays, likes, total hours played, and comments via Supabase.
- Provide a single game template (game.html) that loads by slug so new pages are not required.
- Offer a browse tile page and a separate About page.

Key Files
- index.html: Home page layout, loads games list from games.json.
- browse.html: Tile-only browse page for quick game selection.
- browse.js: Loads games.json, sorts by title, renders browse tiles.
- about.html: About page content and Discord contact button.
- game.html: Default game template; loads a game based on ?game=slug.
- styles.css: Global styling (dark warm tan theme + updated fonts).
- games.json: Single source of truth for games metadata, build paths, page URLs, and tile images.
- app.js: Loads games.json, sorts by updated date, renders cards on home page.
- game-cards.js: Renders each game card, handles click-to-play overlays, single active game, plays/ratings/comments.
- game-page.js: Loads a single game card by slug for game.html.
- supabase-client.js: Supabase URL + anon key config and shared helpers.
- supabase/schema.sql: Tables + RLS policies for play sessions, ratings, comments.

Game Builds
- Live builds are stored under the `Games/` folder.
- Each build must have an index.html that is referenced by games.json.
- buildPath entries in games.json are URL-encoded (spaces as %20).

Adding or Updating a Game
1) Drop the build into `Games/<Your Game Folder>/index.html`.
2) Add/update the entry in games.json:
   - slug: URL-safe id (kebab-case)
   - title/description/tags/controls/updated
   - buildPath: "Games/<Folder Name>/index.html" with spaces encoded
   - pagePath: "game.html?game=<slug>"
   - tileImage: "images/<Image Name>" for browse tiles and play overlay poster (optional)

Click-to-Play Behavior
- The iframe uses data-src until clicked; clicking loads the build and starts play tracking.
- Only one game can be active at a time; activating a new game unloads the previous iframe and finalizes playtime.
- Fullscreen is only allowed via the explicit Fullscreen button; the iframe sandbox blocks auto fullscreen.

Supabase Setup
- Paste the SQL from supabase/schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor and run it.
- Set SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in supabase-client.js.

Hosting
- Site is hosted on Netlify with a custom domain managed by Cloudflare DNS.
- Cloudflare DNS uses DNS-only records (no proxy) for Netlify:
  - A @ -> 75.2.60.5
  - A @ -> 99.83.190.102
  - CNAME www -> <site>.netlify.app
- Netlify should set the primary domain and handle SSL after DNS propagates.

Local Dev
- games.json is loaded via fetch; the site must be served over http(s), not file://.
- Use a local web server (python, node, or any static server) when previewing.
- Update supabase-client.js (note the exact filename) for API keys.

Notes
- The front page orders games by the updated field (newest first).
- Browse page sorts tiles alphabetically by title.
- Ratings are per-client via localStorage; likes count only (dislikes are stored but not displayed).
- Hours played shows total time across play sessions.
